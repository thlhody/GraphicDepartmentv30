# Session Summary - October 14, 2025

## Overview
This session continued work on the Check Register system, focusing on team lead functionality, status management, merge logic, and individual badge clicking feature.

## Previous Session Work (Context)

### 1. Team Lead Initialization Flow
**Requirement**: Team lead must always press "Initialize" button before viewing user register, even if previously initialized.

**Implementation**:
- Modified `TeamCheckRegisterController.loadSelectedUserData()` to always set `needsInitialization=true`
- Created separate method `loadSelectedUserDataAfterInit()` for post-initialization state
- Added `showContent` query parameter to control view state
- Initialize button creates empty team register even if user has no entries

### 2. Fragment Error Fixes
**Issues Fixed in check-register-fragment.html**:
- Duplicate status display columns (removed one)
- Table header mismatch (updated colspan from 14 to 13)
- Thymeleaf syntax errors in delete button confirmation dialog (fixed using literal substitution)
- Complex Thymeleaf expressions with `T()` operator (refactored to use `#strings.startsWith()`)

### 3. Status Preservation During Initialization
**Problem**: Team lead initialization was overwriting all statuses to USER_INPUT.

**Fix**: Changed `CheckRegisterService.initializeTeamCheckRegister()` line 221 from `copyEntryWithUserInput()` to `copyEntry()` to preserve original status.

### 4. User Edit Restrictions and Entry Display
**Changes**:
- Removed JavaScript restriction preventing users from editing team lead entries (tombstone deletion handles conflicts)
- Changed entry ID display from actual IDs to sequential numbers using `${stat.size - stat.index}` (reverse order, newest on top)

### 5. User Edit Status Transitions
**Problem**: User edits turned TEAM_EDITED entries into USER_INPUT instead of USER_EDITED.

**Fix**: Added conditional logic in `CheckRegisterService.saveUserEntry()` lines 481-492:
- New entries (entryId == null) → USER_INPUT
- Updates (entryId exists) → USER_EDITED_{timestamp}

### 6. Enhanced Mark All Checked Logic
**Problem**: "Mark All as Checked" skipped TEAM_EDITED and TEAM_FINAL entries.

**Fix**: Modified `markAllEntriesAsChecked()` to only skip ADMIN_FINAL entries, mark all others (TE/UI/UE/TI) as TEAM_FINAL.

### 7. Individual Badge Clicking Feature (Backend)
**Implementation**:
- Created `markSingleEntryAsTeamFinal()` method in `CheckRegisterService` (lines 340-393)
- Added POST endpoint `/team/check-register/mark-single-entry-final` in `TeamCheckRegisterController` (lines 546-584)
- Only skips ADMIN_FINAL entries (immutable), all others can be marked as TEAM_FINAL

## Current Session Work: Badge Clicking Feature (Frontend)

### Initial Problem
The badge click handler JavaScript function was defined but never being called, despite:
- Badges having correct `clickable-badge` class
- Badges having correct `data-entry-id` attributes
- `IS_TEAM_VIEW` flag set to `true`
- HTML structure being correct

### Root Cause
The `initializeStatusBadgeClickHandlers()` function was being called from the wrong context. It was placed in the general `DOMContentLoaded` handler in `check-register.js`, but needed to be called from the team-check-register.html template's specific script block that only runs when `showRegisterContent` is true.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Badge Handler Initialization
**File**: `src/main/resources/templates/user/team-check-register.html` (lines 203-212)

Added initialization call in the template's script block:
```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
    if (typeof initializeStatusBadgeClickHandlers === 'function') {
        console.log('Calling initializeStatusBadgeClickHandlers from team-check-register.html');
        initializeStatusBadgeClickHandlers();
    }
}, 600);
```

#### 2. CSRF Token Issue
**Problem**: Added CSRF meta tags to layout template, which caused Thymeleaf errors because `_csrf` object doesn't exist in the application context.

**Solution**: Removed CSRF meta tags and CSRF token handling from JavaScript. The application has CSRF disabled in Spring Security configuration.

#### 3. Form Parameter Passing Issue
**Problem**: Badge click handler was getting `year` and `month` parameters from URL, but they were null or empty, causing `MissingServletRequestParameterException`.

**Solution**: Changed to use server-side Thymeleaf variables passed to JavaScript constants (same pattern as "Mark All as Checked" button).

**File**: `src/main/resources/templates/user/team-check-register.html` (lines 192-195)
```javascript
const SELECTED_USER = /*[[${selectedUser?.username}]]*/ null;
const SELECTED_USER_ID = /*[[${selectedUser?.userId}]]*/ null;
const CURRENT_YEAR = /*[[${currentYear}]]*/ null;
const CURRENT_MONTH = /*[[${currentMonth}]]*/ null;
```

**File**: `src/main/resources/static/js/check-register.js` (lines 950-955)
```javascript
const username = typeof SELECTED_USER !== 'undefined' ? SELECTED_USER : null;
const userId = typeof SELECTED_USER_ID !== 'undefined' ? SELECTED_USER_ID : null;
const year = typeof CURRENT_YEAR !== 'undefined' ? CURRENT_YEAR : null;
const month = typeof CURRENT_MONTH !== 'undefined' ? CURRENT_MONTH : null;
```

### CSRF Education
Provided brief explanation of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):
- What it is and how it works
- When CSRF protection is needed vs. not needed
- Why this application doesn't need CSRF tokens (likely disabled in Spring Security)

### Final Result
✅ Badge clicking feature works correctly:
1. Team lead clicks status badge (except ADMIN_FINAL)
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. JavaScript gets context from server-provided constants
4. Form is dynamically created and submitted
5. Entry status updated to TEAM_FINAL
6. Page reloads with updated status

### All Files Modified (Complete Session)

#### Backend (Previous Session)
1. **CheckRegisterService.java**
   - Line 221: Changed initialization to preserve status (`copyEntry()` vs `copyEntryWithUserInput()`)
   - Lines 286-307: Updated `markAllEntriesAsChecked()` to only skip ADMIN_FINAL
   - Lines 340-393: Added `markSingleEntryAsTeamFinal()` method
   - Lines 481-492: Fixed user entry status logic (USER_INPUT vs USER_EDITED)

2. **TeamCheckRegisterController.java**
   - Modified `loadSelectedUserData()` to always require initialization
   - Created `loadSelectedUserDataAfterInit()` for post-init state
   - Lines 56-106: Added `showContent` parameter handling
   - Lines 546-584: Added `markSingleEntryAsTeamFinal()` endpoint

#### Frontend (Both Sessions)
3. **check-register-fragment.html**
   - Fixed duplicate status columns and table header colspan
   - Line 178: Changed to sequential numbering `${stat.size - stat.index}`
   - Lines 209-230: Added clickable status badges with proper styling
   - Fixed Thymeleaf expression syntax errors

4. **check-register.js**
   - Lines 289-299: Removed edit restrictions for TL entries
   - Lines 920-990: Added `initializeStatusBadgeClickHandlers()` function
   - Lines 950-955: Changed to use server-provided constants
   - Lines 993-1008: Added CSS styling for clickable badges
   - Added validation and error handling

5. **team-check-register.html** (Current Session)
   - Lines 192-195: Added server context variables (SELECTED_USER, CURRENT_YEAR, etc.)
   - Lines 203-212: Added badge handler initialization call

6. **layout/default.html** (Current Session)
   - Temporarily added CSRF meta tags (then removed due to errors)

### Key Technical Concepts

#### Status Hierarchy & Merge Logic
- **USER_INPUT** < **USER_EDITED_{timestamp}** < **TEAM_EDITED_{timestamp}** < **TEAM_FINAL** < **ADMIN_FINAL**
- Tombstone deletion system handles conflict resolution (deleted entries marked, not removed)
- Merge engine preserves higher authority statuses during sync

#### Thymeleaf to JavaScript Pattern
Server-side values passed to client-side using inline scripts:
```javascript
const VALUE = /*[[${serverVariable}]]*/ null;
```

#### CSRF in Spring Boot
- CSRF protection disabled in this application's Spring Security config
- Internal/desktop application doesn't require CSRF tokens
- Traditional CSRF needed for cookie-based session auth in public web apps

### Key Takeaways
1. **Always match existing patterns**: Use the same approach as working features (e.g., "Mark All as Checked" button)
2. **Status preservation is critical**: Don't overwrite statuses during initialization or merges
3. **Tombstone deletion**: Never physically delete entries, mark them as deleted with timestamps
4. **Server context over URL params**: More reliable to pass Thymeleaf variables to JavaScript than parse URLs
5. **Test initialization order**: Frontend handlers must be called after DOM and data are fully loaded
