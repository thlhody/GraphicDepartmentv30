Feature: Add Live Work Hours and Live Efficiency metrics to Check Register

Overview:
Enhanced the Check Register Key Metrics section to display actual worked hours (Live Work Hours) and calculate efficiency based on real-time data, providing more accurate performance tracking.

Changes:

New Files:

- src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/service/cache/MetricsCacheService.java
    - In-memory cache for Standard Hours and Live Work Hours calculations
    - Automatic invalidation on worktime data changes
    - Thread-safe ConcurrentHashMap implementation

Modified Files:

1. src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/service/WorkScheduleService.java
   - Added calculateStandardWorkHoursWithCache() - uses cached worktime/timeoff data for accurate work day calculation
   - Added calculateLiveWorkHours() - calculates actual hours worked from worktime entries
   - Integrates with CalculateWorkHoursUtil for lunch break and overtime processing
   - Handles special days (SN/CO/CM/W) vs regular work days correctly
2. src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/service/cache/WorktimeCacheService.java
   - Added MetricsCacheService dependency injection (setter injection to avoid circular dependency)
   - Added automatic metrics cache invalidation in saveMonthEntriesWithWriteThrough()
   - Ensures Live Work Hours refresh when worktime data changes
3. src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/controller/user/CheckRegisterController.java
   - Updated showCheckRegister() to calculate and pass Live Work Hours to view
   - Simplified target units/hour logic (removed redundant WorkScheduleService method)
   - Added error fallback for liveWorkHours attribute
4. src/main/resources/templates/user/check-register.html
   - Reorganized Key Metrics into 2 rows for better readability
   - Added "Live Work Hours" display with tooltip
   - Added "Live Efficiency" display with tooltip
   - Enhanced tooltips explaining each metric
5. src/main/resources/static/js/check-register.js
   - Added Live Efficiency calculation logic
   - Reads liveWorkHours from page element
   - Calculates: (Total Value / (Live Work Hours √ó Target Units/Hour)) √ó 100
   - Applies same color coding as regular efficiency (green/orange/red)

Key Features:

‚úÖ Standard Hours - Accurately calculated based on: (days in month - weekends - timeoff days) √ó schedule‚úÖ Live Work Hours - Real-time calculation from worktime entries with lunch/overtime handling‚úÖ Live Efficiency - Performance
metric based on actual hours worked vs expected‚úÖ Automatic Cache Invalidation - Metrics refresh when worktime data changes‚úÖ Performance Optimized - Results cached to avoid repeated calculations

Technical Details:
- Regular work days: Process raw totalWorkedMinutes through CalculateWorkHoursUtil
- Special days (weekends/holidays): Only count totalOvertimeMinutes
- Skips IN_PROCESS entries (active sessions)
- Thread-safe caching with proper null handling
- Consistent with Time Management page calculations

Testing:
- Compiles successfully with mvn compile
- All calculation logic verified with actual worktime data
- Cache invalidation tested with worktime entry updates

feat: Add Live Work Hours and Live Efficiency metrics to Check Register

- Created MetricsCacheService for caching Standard Hours and Live Work Hours
- Enhanced WorkScheduleService with cache-aware calculations
- Added Live Work Hours calculation using actual worktime entries
- Integrated CalculateWorkHoursUtil for accurate lunch/overtime processing
- Updated Check Register UI to display Live Work Hours and Live Efficiency
- Added automatic metrics cache invalidation on worktime changes
- Removed redundant DEFAULT_TARGET_WORK_UNITS_PER_HOUR from WorkScheduleService

Improves accuracy of efficiency tracking by showing metrics based on
actual hours worked vs scheduled hours, especially useful when users
have significant time off or overtime.
