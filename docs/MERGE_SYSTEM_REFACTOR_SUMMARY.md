# Universal Merge System Refactor - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Version:** 7.2.1
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## Overview

Successfully migrated **Register** and **CheckRegister** merge systems from deprecated legacy logic to the new **Universal Merge Engine** with timestamp-based conflict resolution.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Register Merge System Migration

#### New Files Created
- **`RegisterWrapperFactory`** (`src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/register/util/RegisterWrapperFactory.java`)
  - Adapts `RegisterEntry` to work with `UniversalMergeEngine`
  - Uses `GenericEntityWrapper` pattern

#### Refactored Files
- **`RegisterMergeService`** (`src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/service/RegisterMergeService.java`)
  - Complete rewrite using `UniversalMergeEngine`
  - Implements proper merge logic for:
    - `performUserLoginMerge()` - Admin → User merge on login
    - `performAdminLoadMerge()` - User → Admin merge when admin loads
    - `performAdminSaveProcessing()` - Simplified save logic
  - Removed dependency on deprecated `RegisterMergeRule` and `SyncStatusMerge`
  - Added comprehensive error handling and validation

- **`UserRegisterService`** (`src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/service/UserRegisterService.java`)
  - Replaced `SyncStatusMerge` with `MergingStatusConstants`
  - New entries use `USER_INPUT` status
  - User edits create timestamped `USER_EDITED_[timestamp]` statuses

- **`AdminRegisterService`** (`src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/service/AdminRegisterService.java`)
  - Replaced `SyncStatusMerge` with `MergingStatusConstants`
  - **Reimplemented `confirmAllAdminChanges()`** - Admin force overwrite feature
    - Sets all entries to `ADMIN_FINAL` status (nuclear option)
    - Admin decision becomes absolute and cannot be overridden
    - Use case: Resolving sync conflicts when needed

- **`UserRegisterController`** (`src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/controller/user/UserRegisterController.java`)
  - Removed unused `SyncStatusMerge` import

---

### 2. CheckRegister Merge System Migration

#### New Files Created
- **`CheckRegisterWrapperFactory`** (`src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/checkregister/util/CheckRegisterWrapperFactory.java`)
  - Adapts `RegisterCheckEntry` to work with `UniversalMergeEngine`
  - Uses `GenericEntityWrapper` pattern

#### Refactored Files
- **`CheckRegisterService`** (`src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/service/CheckRegisterService.java`)
  - Updated `mergeEntries()` method to use `UniversalMergeEngine`
  - Removed dependency on deprecated `CheckRegisterMergeRule`
  - Now supports timestamp-based conflict resolution
  - Consistent with `RegisterMergeService` implementation

---

### 3. Deprecated Classes Removed

| File | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `SyncStatusMerge.java` | `src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/enums/` | ✅ Deleted |
| `RegisterMergeRule.java` | `src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/enums/` | ✅ Deleted |
| `CheckRegisterMergeRule.java` | `src/main/java/com/ctgraphdep/enums/` | ✅ Deleted |

## Universal Merge Status System

All merge operations now use consistent status naming:

### Status Types

1. **`[ROLE]_INPUT`** - Initial creation by role
   - `USER_INPUT` - Created by user
   - `ADMIN_INPUT` - Created by admin
   - `TEAM_INPUT` - Created by team lead

2. **`[ROLE]_EDITED_[timestamp]`** - Timestamped edits
   - `USER_EDITED_1696858473892` - User edit with timestamp
   - `ADMIN_EDITED_1696858473892` - Admin edit with timestamp
   - `TEAM_EDITED_1696858473892` - Team lead edit with timestamp
   - **Conflict Resolution:** Newer timestamp wins (admin wins on equal timestamps)

3. **`[ROLE]_FINAL`** - Locked entries
   - `ADMIN_FINAL` - Admin final decision (cannot be overridden)
   - `TEAM_FINAL` - Team final decision (can be overridden only by admin)

### Special Rules

- **`USER_IN_PROCESS`** (worktime only) - User has an active session
  - Only user can create or close `USER_IN_PROCESS`
  - Admin cannot override when user has an active process

---

## Merge Flow

### Register/CheckRegister Merge Flow

1. **User Login Merge** (Admin → User)
   ```
   Admin Network File → Merge with → User Local File → Save to User Local
   ```

2. **Admin Load Merge** (User → Admin)
   ```
   User Network File → Merge with → Admin Local File → Save to Admin Local
   ```

3. **Admin Save Processing**
   ```
   Admin edits → Process entries → Save to Admin Local → Sync to Network
   ```

---

## System-Wide Consistency

All merge systems now use the Universal Merge Engine:

| Entity Type | Model Class | Wrapper Factory | Status Field |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Register** | `RegisterEntry` | `RegisterWrapperFactory` | `adminSync` |
| **CheckRegister** | `RegisterCheckEntry` | `CheckRegisterWrapperFactory` | `adminSync` |
| **Worktime** | `WorktimeEntry` | `WorktimeWrapperFactory` | `adminSync` |

---

## Admin Force Overwrite Feature

### Method
`AdminRegisterService.confirmAllAdminChanges()`

### Purpose
Nuclear option for conflict resolution - sets all entries to `ADMIN_FINAL` status

### Use Case
When synchronization issues or conflicts need immediate resolution, admin can force their current version to become the final version, overriding any user/team changes.

### Behavior
- Reads all admin entries for specified user/month
- Sets all entries to `ADMIN_FINAL` status
- Saves back to admin file with sync and backup
- Returns count of entries marked

---

## Build Status

```
[INFO] Compiling 354 source files with javac [debug release 17]
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

✅ **No compilation errors**
✅ **All deprecated classes removed**
✅ **All services updated**

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] User creates register entry → Verify `USER_INPUT` status
- [ ] User edits existing entry → Verify `USER_EDITED_[timestamp]` status
- [ ] Admin loads user register → Verify merge with admin decisions
- [ ] Admin edits entry → Verify `ADMIN_EDITED_[timestamp]` status
- [ ] Admin confirms all changes → Verify all entries become `ADMIN_FINAL`
- [ ] User login merge → Verify admin decisions sync to user file
- [ ] Team lead creates check entry → Verify `TEAM_INPUT` status
- [ ] User edits after team lead approval → Verify timestamp conflict resolution

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Timestamp Conflicts** - Equal timestamps should resolve to admin priority
2. **Admin Force Overwrite** - All entries should become `ADMIN_FINAL` regardless of current status
3. **Empty Files** - Bootstrap logic should handle missing admin/user files gracefully
4. **Network Failures** - Fallback to local files should work correctly

---

## Migration Impact

### Breaking Changes
❌ **None** - All changes are backward compatible

### Deprecated Features
⚠️ Old status values are automatically normalized to new format during merge operations

### Benefits
- ✅ Consistent merge behavior across all entity types
- ✅ Timestamp-based conflict resolution (no manual intervention needed)
- ✅ Admin override capability for emergency situations
- ✅ Better logging and error handling
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Add unit tests** for merge scenarios
2. **Add integration tests** for end-to-end merge flows
3. **Consider adding UI indicator** for entry status types
4. **Add audit log** for ADMIN_FINAL override actions
